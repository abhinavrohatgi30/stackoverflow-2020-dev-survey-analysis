# StackOverflow Developer Survey Analysis 2020
An exploratory analysis of Stackoverflow's Developer Survey 2020 data to infer the trends from the responses to the survey
I'll be exploring the trends around the factors that influence Job Satisfaction and also look at trends of compensation and work hours across countries
I'll be answering the following questions as part of this survey analysis:

1. What factors influence the Job Satisfaction of Male and Female developers?
2. What factors influence the Job Satisfaction of developers in a Developed (United States) vs Developing (India) country?
3. What are the compensation trends across countries?
4. How many hours do developers work across countries?
5. What factors cause the developers to look for new jobs in a Developed (United States) vs Developing (India) country?
